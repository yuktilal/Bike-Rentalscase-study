## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
-Dataset contains the information like weather,season,tempersature and glossary details to understand data

## Conclusions
- Weathersit seem to influence werathersit_1 seems to influenceare likely associated with higher bike rentals compared to situations with mist, clouds, or precipitation (weathersit_2 and weathersit_3).
- Year says it is better in 2019 as compared to 2018 shows popularity of bikes in increased with increase in time
- The "mnth" variable, representing months from 1 to 12, may have an effect on bike rentals.
- The "weekday" and "workingday" variables indicate the day of the week and whether it's a working day or not. These variables may influence bike rentals, with higher rentals on non-working days and potentially varying patterns on different weekdays.
